# Bayesian Neural Network with TensorFlow

This repository regards the implementation of Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks as described in my thesis. Central for the implementation was the module [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability "TensorFlow Probability Repository"), where much of our technical work was inspired by [Dustin Tran's demo example](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/bayesian_neural_network.py "Trains a deep Bayesian neural net to classify MNIST digits").

The repository is mainly structured as follows:

[Requirements](../blob/master/requirements.txt)
[Data pre-processing](../blob/master/datamanipulation.py)
[Hyperparameter optimisation](../blob/master/bayesianNN.py)
[Get metrics for the final model](../blob/master/finalmodel.py)
